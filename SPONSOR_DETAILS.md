# Cursor

## Track & Prize
- **Track:** Best Project Made with Cursor
- **First Place:** $3,000-5,000 USD Cursor credits
- **All Participants:** $50 USD Cursor credits

## About Cursor

Cursor is an AI-first code editor designed to support developers across the spectrum of AI-assisted programming, from autocomplete to autonomous agents. This guide introduces the fundamentals and walks through key features to help you get productive quickly.

### What is Cursor?

Cursor is a programming environment powered by large language models (LLMs). It lets you generate, edit, and reason about code with AI. Cursor is model-agnostic and includes tools for both light-touch and full-agent workflows.

**Key concepts:**

- **LLMs**: Trained to predict the next token in a sequence. They operate using "context," which includes the current conversation, attached files, and system prompts.
- **Prompt**: The instruction or input you give the model.
- **Context**: The data the model sees when generating a response.
- **Tokens**: Units of text that determine the size and cost of input/output.
- **Model selection**: Choose from different LLMs based on reasoning strength, speed, or cost.

### Core Features

These tools help you work with AI at varying levels of autonomy.

#### Tab (Autocomplete)

- In-house autocomplete model trained on code.
- Suggests multiple lines or blocks.
- Navigates within and across files.
- Stays close to how developers write code manually.

#### Inline Edit

- Highlight code and ask for edits.
- Great for refactoring, rewriting, or adding documentation.
- Triggered with Cmd+K after selecting code.

#### Agent

- AI agent with read/write access to your codebase.
- Modes: Ask (responds to queries) and Agent (takes action).
- Context menu integration for file-level tasks.
- Agent Loop allows multi-step reasoning and tool use.
- Supports background execution on remote VMs.

# ByteRover

## Track & Prize
- **Track:** Best Use of ByteRover CLI for context
- **First Place:** $500 cash prize
- **Top 3 Teams:** 1 year ByteRover Pro – Team Tier ($1,500 in credits per team)
- **All Participants:** 1 month ByteRover Pro coupon

## About ByteRover

ByteRover (http://byterover.dev) is where developer teams Git for context - a **central context layer** to store, recall, version-control coding memory of coding agents.

Engineering teams ship faster by > 50% when pairing ByteRover with coding agents like Cursor / ClaudeCode. With ByteRover:

- Agents are able to access the exact piece of context for every engineering task, producing less redundant code, and keeping context window clean every time.
- Teams can Git coding knowledge for agents, and reuse them together as the whole team.
- It combines a cloud memory workspace with a CLI client so agents can reliably store and retrieve context without you having to manage any custom infrastructure.
- ByteRover CLI 0.3.1 (in beta) introduces two major upgrades: a Context Tree memory structure and a new retrieval technique called Agentic Search.

**ATTENTION!** This Track is only applicable for using ByteRover CLI (beta)

# Byte-In

## Track & Prize
- **Track:** Best Game Developed - "Build a Food-Powered Dungeon Experience"
- **First Place:** $100 USD cash + Custom plushy and t-shirts

## Challenge: Build a Food-Powered Dungeon Experience

Create a playable mobile-friendly game experience where the player's scanned food directly drives gameplay.
A "dungeon" here is broad — it can be a level, a mini-game, a boss fight, a puzzle run, a pet journey, or your own invention.

You can build anything from a classic multi-room dungeon to a food-powered rogue-lite or even a single intense encounter — as long as it uses real scanned food as the core mechanic.

### Your Mission

Design one self-contained dungeon experience (2–15 minutes per run) where:

1. **Scanned food meaningfully affects gameplay**
   - Examples (you can invent your own):
     - Food becomes cards, spells, buffs, debuffs
     - Nutrition stats open/close paths
     - Food health score alters boss behaviors
     - Meals craft items, unlock rooms, evolve pets

2. **Players progress toward a clear outcome**
   - Valid outcomes:
     - Win (clear the dungeon / defeat the boss / solve the puzzle)
     - Lose (HP 0 / time-out / puzzle failed)
     - Partial success (collected some rewards, unlocked a pet, discovered a new path)

3. **Your segment outputs rewards**
   - Required outputs:
     - Tokens earned
     - Pet XP / pet state changes (optional but encouraged)
     - Flags for unlocking future content (e.g., "cleared_room_3", "met_sphinx")

4. **It runs on mobile**
   - Web-based, itch.io, or Vercel accepted. Must be playable on a phone.

# Workshops

## Apify Workshop: Build & Monetize Web Scrapers

**Date:** 5 December 2025
**Time:** 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM (MYT)
**Speaker:** Saurav Jain, Senior Developer Community Manager @ Apify
**Location:** Asia School of Business, Demo Lab 2

### What This Workshop Covers

The Creator Developer Economy offers developers the chance to turn their skills into a passive income stream. In this talk, I'll explore how developers can leverage Apify's tools to build, deploy, and monetize web scraping solutions. From using Crawlee for Python to create efficient scrapers to publishing and earning.

This session will showcase the journey of building and monetizing data extraction tools in 4 steps:

1. Development
2. Publication and set up of monetization
3. Testing
4. Promotion

This will be followed by a live demo of Apify's CLI—a tool to quickly build and deploy Actors. We'll walk through various types of scrapers, or "Actors" as we call them, that can be created. I'll share tips on optimizing these tools for monetization and explain how to engage with the developer community on Discord for support.

To wrap up, I'll share real success stories from developers who earn thousands of dollars monthly by using Apify's platform, highlighting the potential of this ecosystem.

In addition to all of this, we will explain what you can win in the Apify track in the hackathon and how the Apify $1M Challenge can also give you big prizes.

### Who Should Attend

- Builders competing in the Cursor × Anthropic Hackathon
- Developers who want to earn a stable income from their development skills
- Anyone building workflows involving scraping, AI, enrichment, ETL, or automation
- Teams aiming to win the Apify Track prizes:
  - **1st:** $1,000 Apify credits + $500 prepaid Visa card
  - **2nd:** $750 credits + $250 prepaid Visa card
  - **3rd:** $500 credits + $100 prepaid Visa card
  - …and eligibility for the $1M Apify Challenge
  - **All participants:** $50 USD Apify credits

No prior Apify experience required. Beginners welcome; speedrunners encouraged.

### Important: About the Apify Track

The Apify track is about building and publishing your own Actors on the Apify platform—not using existing Actors. Your hackathon project should create a new Actor that others can use. Any project that takes an input and produces an output, including AI Agents, can be an Actor!

### Why Attend

Any project that takes an input and produces an output, including AI Agents, can be an Actor on Apify and can make you earn thousands of dollars every month.

### About Apify

Apify is the biggest marketplace for web automation tools and AI Agents. With over 150,000 monthly sign-ups and more than 25,000 monthly paying customers, Apify Store is thriving. Our community of creators, aka community developers, is building these solutions called Actors and publishing them on Apify Store and earning thousands of dollars every month.
